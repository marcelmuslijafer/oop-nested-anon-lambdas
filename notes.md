## Overview

Iterable, Iterator, nested classes, anonymous classes, and lambdas are important concepts in Java programming.
Understanding these concepts is essential for effective collection iteration, code organization, and functional programming in Java.

## Iterable and Iterator:

Iterable provides a way to iterate over a collection of elements.
Iterator allows traversal and access to elements in a collection.
Implementing Iterable and Iterator interfaces enables custom classes to support iteration.

## Nested Classes:

Nested classes provide a way to logically group classes within another class.
Static nested classes are associated with the outer class but can be accessed independently.
Inner classes are non-static nested classes and have access to the members of the outer class.
Local classes are defined within a method or scope and can access the local variables of the enclosing scope.

## Anonymous Classes:

Anonymous classes are defined without a name and can be used for implementing interfaces or extending abstract classes.
They provide a concise way to define and use classes for specific, one-time purposes.
Anonymous classes can be useful for event handling, callbacks, and customization of behavior.

## Lambdas:

Lambdas are a compact syntax for representing functional interfaces.
Functional interfaces are interfaces with a single abstract method.
Lambdas provide a concise way to write code blocks and pass behavior as arguments.
They are useful for implementing callbacks, defining predicates, mapping data, and simplifying code.
